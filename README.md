#Main Program Algorithm

Since we have 5 ingredients intuitively we shoud devide the quantity of calories and fats and carbohydrates with the ingredients that have the most of them, IÂ´ve decided to divide it by the most important foods of a diet, the protein is the most important food, so, depending if a diet is vegetarian or not the main course will be a protein and everything else will be add-ons, ill divide the ingredients al follows:

- Frutas - 5%
- Verduras - 10%
- Granos - 10%
- Lacteos - 10%
- Proteina - 65%

The maximum quantity of calories will depend on the BMI of the person an whether or not they are fat.

 - x>18.5 is underwheight
 - 18.5<x<24.9 is "Healthy"
 - 25<x<29.9 is "Overweight"
 - 30<x<39.9 is "Obersity"
 - x<40 is "Obesity"

#CalcularCalorias Class

There is however a bug that prevents the user from consulting the menus that they have generated because for some reason the vevctor that class Dieta returns is empty, I have tried to fix it but I have not been able to do so, I have tried to fix it by changing the way the vector is returned, and nothing works and now im out of time to try to correct it


    The class has the following private member variables:
        ingredientes: A vector of pointers to Ingrediente objects. It stores the ingredients used for calculating calories.
        calorias: An integer representing the total calories calculated from the ingredients.

    Public member functions:
        agregarIngrediente(Ingrediente* ingrediente): This function takes a pointer to an Ingrediente object and adds it to the ingredientes vector.
        agregarIngredientes(const std::vector<Ingrediente*>& ingredientesVector): This function takes a vector of pointers to Ingrediente objects and adds them to the ingredientes vector.
        calcularTotalCalorias() const: This function calculates the total calories by summing up the calories of all the ingredients in the ingredientes vector. It returns the total calories as an integer.
        calcularTotalCarbohidratos() const: This function calculates the total amount of carbohydrates by summing up the carbohydrates of all the ingredients in the ingredientes vector. It returns the total carbohydrates as an integer.
        calcularTotalGrasas() const: This function calculates the total amount of fats by summing up the fats of all the ingredients in the ingredientes vector. It returns the total fats as an integer.

    Overloaded operator<<:
        This friend function overloads the << operator to provide a convenient way to print the CalcularCalorias object. It outputs the total calories, total carbohydrates, and total fats by calling the corresponding member functions of CalcularCalorias.

Overall, the CalcularCalorias class is responsible for aggregating ingredients, calculating the total calories, total carbohydrates, and total fats based on the provided ingredients, and providing a printable representation of the calculated values.

#Dieta

    The class has the following private member variables:
        calorias: An integer representing the total calories of the diet. It is initialized to 500 by default but can be set using the parameterized constructor.
