#Main Program Algorithm

Since we have 5 ingredients intuitively we shoud devide the quantity of calories and fats and carbohydrates with the ingredients that have the most of them, IÂ´ve decided to divide it by the most important foods of a diet, the protein is the most important food, so, depending if a diet is vegetarian or not the main course will be a protein and everything else will be add-ons, ill divide the ingredients al follows:

- Frutas - 5%
- Verduras - 10%
- Granos - 10%
- Lacteos - 10%
- Proteina - 65%

The maximum quantity of calories will depend on the BMI of the person an whether or not they are fat.

 - x>18.5 is underwheight
 - 18.5<x<24.9 is "Healthy"
 - 25<x<29.9 is "Overweight"
 - 30<x<39.9 is "Obersity"
 - x<40 is "Obesity"

There is going to be a "Minimum menu version" and for any menu/diet undet that quantity of calories the program will give an error
